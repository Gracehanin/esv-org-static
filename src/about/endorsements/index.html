          Christopher Catherwood, Author and Speaker, Cambridge, England</p>

As a speaker and writer...I want a translation that is faithful to the very words of God since they carry the very message of God to His people. I have found that in the English Standard Version Bible."<br>
          Vicki Courtney, Speaker and Writer</p>
          <p>"Having now read through the ESV several times in my personal devotional life, I have adopted it as the primary text for my teaching and writing ministry. I appreciate...the ESV [because it] retains theological terminology that is at the heart of the Christian faith and exercises care and precision in the translation of nuances and gender language, so as to preserve a text that is as faithful as possible to the original. By the same token, the translators have maintained clarity and literary excellence, making this an accessible translation for modern readers. My hope is that the ESV will draw millions of people into the reading and study of God's Word and into a more intimate relationship with the God of the Word."<br>

          <p>"If we're going to take God's Word to heart and really apply it to our everyday lives, we need to have the confidence that the translation we've chosen is accurate and authentic&mdash;true to the original! The ESV is just such a translation."<br>
          Christin Ditchfield, Author, Founder and President, Take It To Heart Ministries</p>
          <p>"I am delighted to express my great appreciation for the English Standard Version. As soon as I started using the ESV I realized what a treasure it is. I have recently adopted this as my preferred translation for personal Bible study and as the basis of the seminary courses that I teach. (I write this as someone who has been using [another translation] for the past twenty-five years&mdash;and as someone who never expected to make such a change.)"<br>
